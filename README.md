# Determination Font Pack

## ðŸŽ‰ is now on v1.0.1 ðŸŽ‰

This simple texture pack (or should i say font pack) changes the bigFont, goldFont and chatFont to the iconic font used in the game called [Undertale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/).

Big shoutout to [Toby Fox](https://x.com/tobyfox) for making this iconic game and this iconic font for use.

PS: by the way this is my first time creating a texture pack of my own so please dont be ashamed of my work here (I'm a noob when it comes to programming like this)

## Take note though ðŸ¤”

This font pack was published in just 2 days of hardwork using nothing more but my mobile phone, specifically, I use the only resource i have which is this website called [ttf2fnt](https://ttf2fnt.com) and adjusted it to my liking. And **HUGE** contribution to this is some texture packs i currently applied (I am looking at you tetrysTP), without it, this font pack wouldn't exist so thank you so much again!
