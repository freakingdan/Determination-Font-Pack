# Determination Font Pack

## ðŸŽ‰ is now on v1.0.1 ðŸŽ‰

This simple texture pack (or should i say font pack) changes the bigFont, goldFont and chatFont to the iconic font used in the game called [Undertale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/).

Big shoutout to [Toby Fox](https://x.com/tobyfox) for making this iconic game and this iconic font for use.

PS: by the way this is my first time creating a texture pack of my own so please dont be ashamed of my work here (I'm a noob when it comes to programming like this)
